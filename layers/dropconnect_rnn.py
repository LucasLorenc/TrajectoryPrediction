  Arguments:

    activation: Activation function to use.
      Default: hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`).
      If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
      (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
    recurrent_activation: Activation function to use
      for the recurrent step.
      Default: hard sigmoid (`hard_sigmoid`).
      If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
      (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
    use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
    kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix,
      used for the linear transformation of the inputs.
    recurrent_initializer: Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel`
      weights matrix,
      used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
    bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector.
    unit_forget_bias: Boolean.
      If True, add 1 to the bias of the forget gate at initialization.
      Setting it to true will also force `bias_initializer="zeros"`.
      This is recommended in [Jozefowicz et
        al.](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf)
    kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
      the `kernel` weights matrix.
    recurrent_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
      the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.
    bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector.
    kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to
      the `kernel` weights matrix.
    recurrent_constraint: Constraint function applied to
      the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.
    bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector.
    dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the units to drop for
      the linear transformation of the inputs.
    recurrent_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the units to drop for
      the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
    kernel_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the weight units to drop.
    recurrent_kernel_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the weight units to drop.
    use_mc_dropout: Bool when True layer always acts like in "train mode"
      so dropout can be applied also in inference mode
    implementation: Implementation mode, either 1 or 2.
      Mode 1 will structure its operations as a larger number of
      smaller dot products and additions, whereas mode 2 will
      batch them into fewer, larger operations. These modes will
      have different performance profiles on different hardware and
      for different applications.

  Call arguments:
    inputs: A 2D tensor.
    states: List of state tensors corresponding to the previous timestep.
    training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
      training mode or in inference mode. Only relevant when `dropout` or
      `recurrent_dropout` is used.

  """Long Short-Term Memory layer - Hochreiter 1997.

   Note that this cell is not optimized for performance on GPU. Please use
  `tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.CuDNNLSTM` for better performance on GPU.

  Arguments:
    units: Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.
    activation: Activation function to use.
      Default: hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`).
      If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
      (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
    recurrent_activation: Activation function to use
      for the recurrent step.
      Default: hard sigmoid (`hard_sigmoid`).
      If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
      (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
    use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
    kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix,
      used for the linear transformation of the inputs..
    recurrent_initializer: Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel`
      weights matrix,
      used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
    bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector.
    unit_forget_bias: Boolean.
      If True, add 1 to the bias of the forget gate at initialization.
      Setting it to true will also force `bias_initializer="zeros"`.
      This is recommended in [Jozefowicz et
        al.](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf).
    kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
      the `kernel` weights matrix.
    recurrent_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
      the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.
    bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector.
    activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
      the output of the layer (its "activation")..
    kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to
      the `kernel` weights matrix.
    recurrent_constraint: Constraint function applied to
      the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.
    bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector.
    dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the units to drop for
      the linear transformation of the inputs.
    recurrent_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the units to drop for
      the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
    kernel_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the weight units to drop.
    recurrent_kernel_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
      Fraction of the weight units to drop.
    use_mc_dropout: Bool when True layer always acts like in "train mode"
      so dropout can be applied also in inference mode
    implementation: Implementation mode, either 1 or 2.
      Mode 1 will structure its operations as a larger number of
      smaller dot products and additions, whereas mode 2 will
      batch them into fewer, larger operations. These modes will
      have different performance profiles on different hardware and
      for different applications.
    return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output.
      in the output sequence, or the full sequence.
    return_state: Boolean. Whether to return the last state
      in addition to the output.
    go_backwards: Boolean (default False).
      If True, process the input sequence backwards and return the
      reversed sequence.
    stateful: Boolean (default False). If True, the last state
      for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial
      state for the sample of index i in the following batch.
    unroll: Boolean (default False).
      If True, the network will be unrolled,
      else a symbolic loop will be used.
      Unrolling can speed-up a RNN,
      although it tends to be more memory-intensive.
      Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.
    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` tensors.
      If True, the inputs and outputs will be in shape
      `(timesteps, batch, ...)`, whereas in the False case, it will be
      `(batch, timesteps, ...)`. Using `time_major = True` is a bit more
      efficient because it avoids transposes at the beginning and end of the
      RNN calculation. However, most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by
      default this function accepts input and emits output in batch-major
      form.

  Call arguments:
    inputs: A 3D tensor.
    mask: Binary tensor of shape `(samples, timesteps)` indicating whether
      a given timestep should be masked.
    training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
      training mode or in inference mode. This argument is passed to the cell
      when calling it. This is only relevant if `dropout` or
      `recurrent_dropout` is used.
    initial_state: List of initial state tensors to be passed to the first
      call of the cell.
